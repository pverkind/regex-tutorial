    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Regular expressions are a very powerful tool to extract information from
      text. Basically, regular expressions are a way to formulate complicated search
      queries ("patterns") in such a way that a computer can understand them.
      There exist many good sources for learning regular expressions, but most
      of them (including <a href="https://regexone.com/" target="_blank">regexone.com</a>, by
      which this tutorial is inspired) are geared towards programmers, and their
      examples are not directly relevant to humanists, which can make it difficult
      to see the usefulness of regular expressions for humanists. This tutorial is
      specifically aimed at students and researchers in the humanities.
