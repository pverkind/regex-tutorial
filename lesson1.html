    <h2>1. Literal characters: letters</h2>
    <p>
      Computers see text as a sequence of characters; in computer science,
      such a sequence of characters is referred to as a 'string' (the imagery
      is of characters as beads on a string, like a necklace). Everything in
      a text is considered a character in a string: not only letters and digits,
      but also whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks), punctuation and all other
      symbols you find on your keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to retrieve information from a string using regular expressions,
      we write patterns that match specific sequences of characters in that
      string. These patterns are also built up of characters. There are two
      types of characters in regular expressions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>metacharacters</strong>: characters that have a special meaning
        that differs from their usual meaning in regular text.
        There are only 14 of these special characters
        (we will discuss their special powers in the next lessons): <br/>
        <span class="regex">{}[]()^$.|*+?\</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        all other characters in regular expressions are
        <strong>literal characters</strong>, and have their usual meaning:
        the character <span class="regex">t</span> in a regex (short for regular
        expression pattern) will match a lower-case letter "t" in a text string,
        the character <span class="regex">ل</span> in a regex will match the
        Arabic letter lām ("ل") in a text string, and so on.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      NB: in the lessons in this tutorial, we will always highlight regular
      expressions in the lesson text in light grey, and put them in a different
      font and color, to distinguish them from regular text.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest regular expression pattern consist entirely of literal
      characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below you will find a number of sample text strings.
      In the search box below the sample strings, write a pattern that uses
      only literal characters to match the common word in all three lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you start typing your pattern, you will see that all sequences of
      characters that match your pattern are highlighted (the color of the
      highlighting is alternating between green and blue to show separate
      matches).
    </p>
    <p>
      A <span class="CORRECT">&#10004</span> symbol will be displayed
      next to those sample strings your pattern matches correctly,
      and a <span class="FALSE">&#10008</span> sign will show you in
      which strings your pattern did not match the desired characters.
      Once your regex pattern correctly matches the desired characters in each
      string, you can move to the next lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you get stuck, click the
      link below the search box to get a hint; if you still don't know how to
      write the pattern after the hint, you can ask for the solution to be
      displayed.

      A regular expression pattern sometimes consists simply of the exact same
      letters (or other literal characters) that you want to match in the string.
